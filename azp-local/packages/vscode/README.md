# Azure Pipelines Local Runner

Draws any Azure Pipelines YAML file as the Azure DevOps portal does, and runs its jobs on your machine: one Docker container per job, one process per step. It works offline, with no Azure DevOps account, on the file as it is in your editor.

It complements Microsoft's [Azure Pipelines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azure-devops.azure-pipelines) extension, which provides syntax highlighting, schema validation and IntelliSense.

## What you get

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Pipelines view** | Every pipeline file in the workspace, with its stages, jobs and steps. Status icons and durations after a run. |
| **Graph** | Stages as columns, jobs as cards with their matrix legs, arrows for `dependsOn`, badges for conditions and task tiers. Live while running. |
| **Step logs** | Read-only documents with timestamps, folding `##[group]` sections, and file references that link to your source. |
| **Run summary** | Result, duration, test results, coverage, artifacts, uploaded summaries, and the list of what did not run as it would on Azure DevOps. |
| **Runs view** | Past local runs. Opening one restores its graph and logs. |
| **In the editor** | *Run pipeline / stage / job* and *Show in graph* above stages and jobs. Expansion errors and failed steps as diagnostics. |
| **Testing view** | JUnit results published by a step appear as test results, linked to source. |

## Commands

All under **Pipelines (local)** in the Command Palette:

- *Show pipeline graph*, *Expand to final YAML*
- *Run pipeline*, *Re-run failed jobs*, *Cancel run*. Run stage, run job and *Run step and those before it* are on the tree, the graph and CodeLens.
- *Set parameters and variables for this run*, *Manage secrets*
- *Doctor*: checks Docker, images and disk, and lists what a pipeline uses that needs a decision.

A run can also be a VS Code task:

```jsonc
{ "type": "azp-local", "pipeline": "azure-pipelines.yml", "job": "build", "label": "pipeline: build" }
```

## How a local run differs from Azure DevOps

A local pass means the steps work here. It does not satisfy a branch policy, and it does not prove the run passes on Azure DevOps.

- **The image is not the hosted image.** `ubuntu-*` pools run in a slim Ubuntu container the extension builds on first use (git, curl, Node.js, Python, PowerShell, Docker CLI). Pipelines that install their own tools are unaffected. Map another image in `.azp-local.yml`.
- **Tasks come in three tiers**, shown before anything runs. Tier 1 is built in: `script`, `bash`, `pwsh`, `powershell`, `checkout`, `download`, `publish`, `Cache@2`, `UseNode@1`, `NodeTool@0`, pipeline and build artifact tasks, `PublishTestResults@2` (JUnit), `PublishCodeCoverageResults`. Tier 2 runs a task's own Node handler from a folder you map. Tier 3 needs a service connection and cannot run locally.
- **A step that could not run is never counted as passed.** It is drawn in its own state, the job ends *succeeded with gaps*, and the summary lists it.
- **Windows jobs** run only in host mode (directly on a Windows machine, not isolated), and only when you opt in. **macOS jobs** do not run.
- **Triggers, approvals, checks and environments** are shown, not enforced.
- **Templates are expanded locally.** A construct the expander does not cover is an error on the line that uses it, never a guess.

## Configuration

A self-contained pipeline needs none. Anything specific to a repository goes in one optional file at its root, `.azp-local.yml`:

```yaml
images:                    # pool or vmImage label -> container image, or "host"
  windows-2025: host
  MyOnPremPool: ghcr.io/acme/onprem-agent:latest
repositories:              # resources.repositories alias -> local folder
  templates: ../shared-pipeline-templates
parameters:                # values for template parameters
  environment: dev
variables:                 # variables and predefined-variable overrides
  Build.Reason: PullRequest
variableGroups:
  release-settings:
    region: westeurope
    apiKey: { secret: true }   # prompted for, kept in the OS keychain
tasks:                     # tasks that cannot run locally
  AzureWebApp@1: skip
  AzureCLI@2: { script: ./ci/local/azure-cli-stub.sh }
  MyCompanyTask@3: { path: ../tasks/MyCompanyTask }
workspace: copy            # copy (default) | mount
```

Personal preferences are VS Code settings: `azpLocal.maxParallelJobs`, `azpLocal.keepContainersOnFailure`, `azpLocal.matchHostedHardware`, `azpLocal.dockerHost`, `azpLocal.codeLens`.

## Security

Running a pipeline executes code from the repository.

- Nothing runs in an untrusted workspace; only the graph is drawn.
- A job gets a **copy** of the files git tracks plus untracked files that are not ignored. Ignored files such as `.env` are not copied, and steps cannot change your working tree.
- Containers get no credentials: no Docker socket, no host network, no home directory.
- Secrets live in VS Code's secret storage, reach a step only through its `env:`, and are masked in logs.
- Host mode has no isolation. It is off unless `.azp-local.yml` maps a pool to `host`.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop (dockerd engine) or Podman's Docker-compatible socket, for running container jobs. The graph and expansion work without it.
- No telemetry is collected.
